Our jobs aren’t just about giving guests a smooth check\\-in and check\\-out. Instead, we want to build and experience that is memorable and unique. Our Guest Experience Experts take the initiative to deliver a wide range of services that guide guests through their entire stay. They are empowered to move about their space and do what needs to be done. Whether processing operational needs, addressing guest requests, completing reports, or sharing the highlights of the local area, the Guest Experience Expert makes transactions feel like part of the experience.

  



No matter what position you are in, there are a few things that are critical to success – creating a safe work place, following company policies and procedures, maintaining confidentiality, protecting company assets, upholding quality standards, and ensuring your uniform, personal appearance, and communications are professional. Guest Experience Experts will be on their feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended time) and taking a hands\\-on approach to work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 10 pounds without assistance). Doing all these things well (and other reasonable job duties as requested) is critical for Guest Experience Experts – to get it right for our guests and our business each and every time.

Our jobs aren’t just about putting food on the table that our guests will enjoy until they ask for their bill. Instead, we want to build an experience that is memorable and unique – with food and drinks on the side. Our Guest Service Experts take the initiative and deliver a wide range of services to make sure that guests enjoy their meal.

Guest Service Experts will be on their feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended time; moving over sloping, uneven, or slippery surfaces), managing the menu (read and visually verify information), and taking a hands\\-on approach to work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 25 pounds without assistance and 50 pounds with assistance; reach overhead and below the knees, including bending, twisting, pulling, and stooping). Doing all these things well (and other reasonable job duties as requested) is critical for Guest Service Experts – to get it right for our guests and our business each and every time.

Our jobs aren’t just about mixing drinks. Instead, we want to build an experience that is memorable and unique. Our bartenders have the basics down, but are constantly on the look\\-out for new trends, micro\\-local offerings, and guests’ evolving needs. They are not just a beverage enthusiast, but also the host of the space. Their role goes beyond the bar itself to take ownership of guest service more broadly and do what needs to be done. Bartenders will use their knowledge and expertise to make the bar look and function flawlessly. They will build relationships with others across the hotel and in the community, to anticipate and deliver on our guests’ needs. They should be passionate about the guest service experience, but also have an eye for detail – from the money that moves through their hands, to the information they provide to guests, to the quality of their drinks.
