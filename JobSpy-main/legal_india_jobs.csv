This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

You’ll also drive compliance with regulatory requirements across the business. This is a global, individual contributor role based at Carmeuse’s headquarters in Belgium, requiring a strong mix of technical expertise, business understanding, and the ability to deliver practical outcomes in a complex environment.  



Your core focus will be Identity \\& Access Management (IAM) — including managing privileged access, improving Joiner\\-Mover\\-Leaver processes, and developing a scalable Identity Governance (IGA) framework using technologies. Your goal will be to bring structure, visibility, and sustained progress to identity processes without overengineering or disrupting business operations.  



Beyond IAM, you will support compliance\\-related activities, including GDPR, NIS2, and other applicable regulations. You’ll translate legal and regulatory requirements into practical technical and procedural controls, and collaborate closely with IT, HR, Legal, and other stakeholders to ensure sustainable compliance.  



We’re looking for someone who can deliver immediate, tactical wins to improve daily operations, while also developing the longer\\-term strategy for a sustainable Identity \\& Compliance Program. This role requires both hands\\-on technical capabilities and leadership skills to drive cross\\-functional alignment and influence stakeholders across the organization.  



To succeed in this role, you’ll need real\\-world experience in identity, sound judgment, and the ability to work effectively within real constraints.  



You should also have proven experience building IAM and IGA capabilities from the ground up —connecting fragmented responsibilities, defining clear ownership, and creating the necessary structures to integrate identity\\-related processes across IT, Security, HR, and the wider organization.  



**Role \\& Responsabilities:**

Under the supervision of the Global Cyber Security Director your role will include the following tasks and responsibilities:


* Own and manage the global Identity \\& Access Management framework (80%), with a strong focus on privileged access, Joiner\\-Mover\\-Leaver lifecycle automation, and scalable identity governance practices.
* Lead the consolidation and optimization of privileged access tools across the organization.
* Design and implement Identity Governance capabilities using Microsoft and ServiceNow, including role definitions, access reviews, and approval workflows.
* Drive integration across fragmented identity processes by working closely with IT, HR, and Security to establish clear ownership and end\\-to\\-end accountability.
* Support the day\\-to\\-day management of SSO and MFA, onboarding new applications and ensuring secure authentication for global users.
* Develop and maintain practical identity\\-related policies, standards, and procedures, tailored to operational realities and regulatory expectations.
* Support regulatory compliance initiatives (20%) (e.g. GDPR) by translating legal requirements into actionable identity and access controls and assisting with audits and reporting.
* Serve as the global point of contact and subject matter expert for identity and compliance topics— advising stakeholders, sharing best practices and driving continuous improvement.


**Skills \\& qualifications**
* You hold a bachelor’s or master’s degree in computer science, IT Security, or a related field — or you have equivalent practical experience.
* You have at least 5 years of hands\\-on experience in IAM, with direct involvement in privileged access, Identity Governance, and Joiner\\-Mover\\-Leaver automation.
* You’re confident working with tools \\& technologies and have experience of deploying or managing them in production environments.
* You are familiar with compliance requirements related to GDPR, NIS2, and access governance, and know how to translate them into practical controls (industry\\-aligned).
* You’re skilled at collaborating across functions — including IT, HR, Security, and Legal — and can connect fragmented ownership into a cohesive identity framework.
* You bring common sense and a pragmatic mindset, balancing security, usability, and operational needs. You know how to find consensus between conflicting requirements.
* You’re comfortable navigating complex environments with legacy systems, shifting priorities, and cross\\-functional dependencies.
* You communicate clearly and effectively — translating technical topics for non\\-technical audiences and vice versa.
* You’re fluent in English; additional languages are a plus.
* You’re open to occasional travel to support global coordination (not often, maximum 3X per year – US).
* Certifications such as CIPM, CISM, SC\\-300 (Microsoft Entra), or CIAM are a strong plus.

**The team:**

Your manager will be Eugene Marchenko:


Eugene is our IT Cyber Security Director and is a member of Jose Voisin (our Group CIO) team.
