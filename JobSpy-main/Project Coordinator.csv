 You will own and be accountable for the end\\-to\\-end, on\\-service project management of titles from across the globe.

 You will help shape and redesign existing workflows to help accelerate the efficiency of our operations in line with key business objectives for our group.
   

  

* Partner with internal and external teams (vendors) to ensure operational momentum and seamlessness across launches.
* Exercise sound judgment and risk mitigation to create/modify delivery and launch plans including use cases that fall outside the norm.
* Partner with our Technology, Engineering, Partnerships, and Quality Control teams within Product Discovery and Promotion (PDP) Operations, to guide tooling, workflow, and vendor needs to help scale operations.


**What You’ll Need**
* Excellent project management skills and the ability to keep multiple priorities moving at the same time.
* Extensive experience in contributing to scale initiatives/projects with clear business impact
* Experience externalizing workflows to vendors
* Experience in a global organization and team
* Excellent verbal and written communication skills
* An analytical and innovative mindset
* A passion for operations and a thirst to do more with less, to work smarter not harder
* A tools\\-first mentality reserving human activity for where judgment and communication are critical
* The ability to build deep cross\\-functional relationships
* A business and team\\-first attitude (naturally selfless)
