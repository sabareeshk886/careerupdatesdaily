**But maybe YOU WONDER WHAT’S OUR STORY ?**
-------------------------------------------

\\-


We are convinced that people don’t want a job anymore!  

They are thirsty for a project with meaning, either through entrepreneurship, or intrapreneurship


But…making it happen is quite hard without finding what truly inspires you and learning the soft skills you need to get there : productivity, leadership, public speaking, coaching, stress management…


This is why we craft trainings \\& educational content to provide **a set of tools and strategies centered around soft skills, self\\-growth and performance.**  

We deliver through apps, e\\-learning platforms, events and a strong social media presence.

**Paradox has one goal: to help people and organizations live their true ambition**

**The challenge is that some people experience learning as boring, too hard, or on the contrary : for losers.**  

Yeah, we all experienced that boring teacher or stumble on this video with unsubstantiated/crazy theories


It needs to change!!


So we travel the world with learning designers, and researchers and surround ourselves with top entrepreneurs ( Richard Branson, Marc Simoncini, Fred Mazzella ), top athletes (Mike Horn, Frank Leboeuf), artists (Gad Elmaleh, Barry Osborne, producer of Lord of the Rings and Matrix)... to reverse engineer their strategies.

**️Our ambition is to make our trainings and coaching as attractive as watching Netflix and to make success the only option for our clients. (whatever success means for them)**


So far, this approach has paid off and has enabled us to exceed 2 million followers on social networks, and to organize online events and training courses attended by thousands of people.


But we wanted more, so we created new brands with international ambitions.

**And with them we have 3 dreams :**

* Helping 100 000 people achieve 1 dream and stick their pictures on a wall we call the 100 000 dreams WALL
* Have Will Smith and Richard Branson in our next documentary
* Reinvent Education \\& Create a badass platform to develop yourself


And that's where you come in.
