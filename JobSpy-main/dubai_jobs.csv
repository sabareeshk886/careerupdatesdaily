**Diversity, Equity and Inclusion are core principles at UNDP: we value diversity as an expression of the multiplicity of nations and cultures where we operate, we foster inclusion as a way of ensuring all personnel are empowered to contribute to our mission, and we ensure equity and fairness in all our actions. Taking a ‘leave no one behind’ approach to our diversity efforts means increasing representation of underserved populations. People who identify as belonging to marginalized or excluded populations are strongly encouraged to apply. Learn more about working at UNDP including our values and** **inspiring stories.**  

**UNDP does not tolerate sexual exploitation and abuse, any kind of harassment, including sexual harassment, and discrimination. All selected candidates will, therefore, undergo rigorous reference and background checks.**  

The Knowledge Project is a joint initiative between UNDP’s Regional Bureau for Arab States (RBAS) and the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Knowledge Foundation (MBRF) established in 2008\\. It aims to promote knowledge societies and policies as transformational means to achieving sustainable development in the Arab States region and beyond. The project builds on the Arab Knowledge Reports, the Arab Knowledge Index, the knowledge4all portal, the Arab Reading Index, the KnowTalks series, the Future of Knowledge Foresight Report series and the Global Knowledge Index (GKI).

About The Sheffield Private School



The Sheffield Private School is a British style school and member of the BSME offering a well\\-balanced, ‘Ultra’ curriculum that follows the English National Curriculum for children aged 3 to 18 years old. As a school founded in 2004, we have a strong community spirit and a dedicated educational faculty who hold inclusion close to their hearts. We believe that learning should be ‘limitless’ as we continue the journey to become a High Performance Learning (HPL) accredited school where learners will develop the values, attitudes and attributes supporting both their educational and life prospects. HLP underpins everything that we do at TSPS; there are no limits to learning.

We believe that academic excellence should be accessible to students across all backgrounds at affordable fees. Our vision is to make TSPS the leading affordable British style school in Dubai. We enable our students to reach far beyond the curriculum, enabling them to become young adults who are considerate of others, have the ability to listen and consider other perspectives and then to form their own opinions and have the assurance to voice those opinions.



The school is located in Al Nahda, Dubai; a residential area with a strong sense of community. The school has students from over 65 nationalities reflecting the international context of the local area and of Dubai.



Parents are very much involved in the school and we have a strong PTA who support both families and the school as a whole.



The school comprises a range of modern facilities including a dedicated healthcare centre, IT and science labs, a spacious library, specialised BTEC, Post 16 and Inclusion rooms, playgrounds and a swimming pool. All our classrooms are equipped with interactive smartboards and displays and we encourage our students to bring their own devices from Year 3 upwards. Learning Innovation is an area we are exploring continuously with our current aim to become a Microsoft showcase school next year.



Not only do we focus on academics, our sports achievements have been remarkable too. TSPS was the U16 DASSA Champions 2018\\-19, remaining unbeaten against premium schools in Dubai. Our swim squad won the EISSA Swimming Gala U14 and U12 in 2018\\-19\\. We hope to retain our sporting accolades once competitive school sports restart in Dubai.



As befits an HPL school we are continually improving and striving for higher achievements. The school also runs a dedicated enrichment programme, with various recreational and academic clubs and activities to further students’ understanding of a subject area and aid their personal development.



Dubai itself is a city like no other, well known for its cosmopolitan lifestyle, luxury shopping, incredible architecture and lively social scene. Whether you are someone who marvels at the skyscrapers, enjoys time at the beach or a desert safari, Dubai has it all. For more information on Dubai please follow the link below

**MAISON**
----------------------

The Fendi Maison was established by Adele and Edoardo Fendi in Rome in 1925\\. The opening of the first Fendi boutique – a handbag shop and fur workshop followed. Soon winning international acclaim, Fendi emerged as a brand renowned for its elegance, craftsmanship, innovation and style.
  

Called by the legendary five Fendi sisters, the collaboration with the late Karl Lagerfeld began back in 1965 and lasted 54 years. In 1992, Silvia Venturini Fendi seconded him in the Artistic Direction; in 1994, she is given the direction of Accessories and later of Menswear.
  

In 2000, the LVMH group acquires Fendi becoming in 2001 its majority shareholder. Appointed in 2020, Kim Jones held the role of Artistic Director of Couture and Womenswear until 2024\\. Since 2020, Delfina Delettrez Fendi, fourth generation of the Fendi family, is Artistic Director of Jewellery. Today Fendi is synonymous with quality, tradition, experimentation and creativity.","Retail","https://ae.indeed.com/cmp/Fendi","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/89c33ef7ca7edb79c7b9ea3307f4c91a","https://www.fendi.com","Rome","51 to 200","$5M to $25M (USD)","","","","","","","","","",""
