The market for Data Science has rapidly evolved into **Generative AI** and **Production MLOps**. This internship is designed for the 2024 graduate who recognizes that basic, generic course certifications (Python, Pandas, simple ML) are no longer sufficient to secure top\\-tier MNC placements.

We are seeking candidates prepared to tackle production\\-grade AI challenges.

**Internship Responsibilities: Advanced Skill Requirements**

The intern will work on mission\\-critical, production\\-grade projects that necessitate deep expertise in the following:

**1\\. Generative AI (LLM) Implementation**

* Design and deploy end\\-to\\-end **RAG (Retrieval\\-Augmented Generation)** pipelines for customized enterprise solutions.

* Implement and query specialized **Vector Databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate)** for efficient unstructured data management (essential for RAG).
* Containerize models using **Docker** and manage deployment workflows using **Kubernetes** concepts.
* Utilize MLOps platforms like **AWS SageMaker** or **Azure ML Services** for CI/CD of models.
* Apply advanced **Deep Learning (DL)** frameworks (**PyTorch/TensorFlow**) for complex projects.
* Expert proficiency in **Python** (NumPy, Pandas) and complex **SQL**.

**Mandatory Qualifications \\& Screening Criteria**

* **Academic:** 2024 Pass\\-Out (B.Tech/M.Tech/MCA/M.Sc.) in a quantitative field.
* **Skill Demonstration:** Must provide a portfolio with demonstrable, hands\\-on experience in at least **two** of the following: **RAG Implementation, Vector Database Utilization,** or **LLM Fine\\-Tuning.**

**Career Development Advisory**

Due to the highly advanced and current skill requirements of this role, we understand that exceptional candidates may possess the aptitude but lack specific project experience in these newest domains.

If you are highly motivated and aiming for these elite roles but do not currently meet all the project\\-based requirements, you are encouraged to contact our team for a **Skill Gap Evaluation.** Our advisory team can help clarify the current industry standards.

Singularis Software Technologies is aggressively recruiting **2024 Graduates** for a highly demanding, project\\-based **Advanced AI Internship**. This is a merit\\-only program for those serious about landing a high\\-paying role with MNCs in the Data Science and Generative AI domains.

The market for Data Science has rapidly evolved into **Generative AI** and **Production MLOps**. This internship is designed for the 2024 graduate who recognizes that basic, generic course certifications (Python, Pandas, simple ML) are no longer sufficient to secure top\\-tier MNC placements.

We are seeking candidates prepared to tackle production\\-grade AI challenges.

**Internship Responsibilities: Advanced Skill Requirements**

The intern will work on mission\\-critical, production\\-grade projects that necessitate deep expertise in the following:

**1\\. Generative AI (LLM) Implementation**

* Design and deploy end\\-to\\-end **RAG (Retrieval\\-Augmented Generation)** pipelines for customized enterprise solutions.
* Work with and fine\\-tune modern **Large Language Models (LLMs)** such as **Llama 3** and **Mistral**, moving beyond basic API consumption.
* Master advanced **Prompt Engineering** and model optimization techniques.

**2\\. MLOps, DL, \\& Data Engineering**

* Implement and query specialized **Vector Databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate)** for efficient unstructured data management (essential for RAG).
* Containerize models using **Docker** and manage deployment workflows using **Kubernetes** concepts.
* Utilize MLOps platforms like **AWS SageMaker** or **Azure ML Services** for CI/CD of models.
* Apply advanced **Deep Learning (DL)** frameworks (**PyTorch/TensorFlow**) for complex projects.
* Expert proficiency in **Python** (NumPy, Pandas) and complex **SQL**.

**Mandatory Qualifications \\& Screening Criteria**

* **Academic:** 2024 Pass\\-Out (B.Tech/M.Tech/MCA/M.Sc.) in a quantitative field.
* **Skill Demonstration:** Must provide a portfolio with demonstrable, hands\\-on experience in at least **two** of the following: **RAG Implementation, Vector Database Utilization,** or **LLM Fine\\-Tuning.**

**Career Development Advisory**

Due to the highly advanced and current skill requirements of this role, we understand that exceptional candidates may possess the aptitude but lack specific project experience in these newest domains.

If you are highly motivated and aiming for these elite roles but do not currently meet all the project\\-based requirements, you are encouraged to contact our team for a **Skill Gap Evaluation.** Our advisory team can help clarify the current industry standards.

* Trial project or case study (optional, for final candidates)
* Offer discussion including equity/profit structure

**EQUAL OPPORTUNITY STATEMENT**

**FAQ \\- ADDRESSING THE ""CO\\-FOUNDER"" CONCERN**

**Q: Why aren't you calling this a ""co\\-founder"" role?**  
A: Because Indeed has specific policies about equity\\-based positions. By positioning this as a specialized professional role with performance\\-based equity opportunity, we attract serious candidates AND comply with Indeed's guidelines. Equity discussions happen after mutual vetting.

**Q: Will this person really get 50% profit share?**  
A: This role offers **meaningful equity participation** (25\\-50% range possible) based on:

* Proven performance in first 6 months (enrollment targets, revenue generation)
* Mutual commitment and alignment with company vision
* Vesting schedule typically over 2\\-4 years
* Formalized through a co\\-founder/partnership agreement after trial period

**Q: Won't people misinterpret this as just another job?**  
A: Not if you emphasize in your interview conversations:

* ""This isn't a traditional employee role""
* ""We're looking for someone with entrepreneur mindset""
* ""Top performers see genuine equity and profit participation""
* ""You'll help shape the academy's direction and strategy""

**Q: How do I phrase the equity conversation in interviews?**  
A: During final interview stages:

* ""This role has significant upside potential. For someone who hits targets and proves themselves in 3\\-6 months, we're open to formalized partnership with equity stake and profit\\-sharing.""
* ""We're building this together, not hiring someone to execute. You'll be part of ownership journey.""
* Provide them with clear metrics: ""If you hit X enrollments and Y revenue targets by Q2, let's discuss 40\\-50% equity stake with vesting.""

 With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in\\-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in\\-office each week, we simply
 **spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field** 
 with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.
