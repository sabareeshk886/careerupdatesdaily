### **The Roku Culture**



Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast\\-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor.

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem\\-solvers, which itself is a two\\-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002\\.

### **Roku is changing how the world watches TV**



Roku is the \\#1 TV streaming platform in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and we've set our sights on powering every television in the world. Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem. We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.



From your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable \\- and valued \\- contribution. We're a fast\\-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.

  


**About the role**



Our **Search Platform** sits at the heart of the Roku experience, powering voice, text, and visual discovery across **100M\\+ active accounts** and every Roku\\-powered device worldwide.  

 We own the entire stack —from ingesting \\& enriching a multi\\-million\\-title knowledge graph, to low\\-latency retrieval services and large\\-scale machine\\-learning systems that personalize results in real time. Our work doesn’t just help users *find* shows; it drives core product surfaces (home\\-screen rows, browse hubs, Roku Voice, mobile app search) and fuels partner monetization. If you enjoy turning cutting\\-edge research into products used billions of times a day, you’ll thrive here.



Roku’s footprint has more than quadrupled in the past five years, and user expectations have leaped just as fast—think **LLM\\-based query understanding, vector\\-DB retrieval, on\\-device models, and multimodal search** (voice, text, image). We’re now rebuilding our relevance stack for the next decade, blending classic IR with generative\\-AI techniques. You will be a technical leader spearheading that transformation.


**What you'll be doing**


* Apply state of the art ML on search using techniques in deep learning, bandits, transformers, LLMs, causal inference, and optimizations to make our users more delighted and engaged on the platform
* Run online AB tests and analyze them against the critical business KPIs
* Collaborate with US engineering teams as well as cross\\-functional teams to translate business requirements into technical specifications
* Nurture our ML ecosystem to make it withstand scale, developer velocity and future business shifts
* Provide technical leadership to drive technical and ML roadmap for search ranking and monetization
* Help recruiting new engineers. Interview, train, and mentor new team members  

  

**We're excited if you have**
* 7\\+ years of experience (or PhD with 5 years of experience) applying Machine Learning to concrete problems at large\\-scale in domains like recommendation or search or ads
* Strong CS fundamentals. Should be able covert ideas to code with ease
* Good understanding of machine learning fundamentals like classification, deep neural nets, and sequence\\-based models. Familiarity with modern NLP stack and multi\\-modal representation learning is a plus
* We'd love to see that you've worked with big data systems (Spark, S3, and Airflow) and can program (Java, Scala, or Python)
* Good understanding of system architecture
* Experience in big data technologies and streaming architecture, data pipelines, etc.
* MS in Computer Science, Statistics, or related field, but a Ph.D. in CS or related fields is preferred
* AI literacy and curiosity.You have either tried Gen AI in your previous work or outside of work or are curious about Gen AI and have explored it.
