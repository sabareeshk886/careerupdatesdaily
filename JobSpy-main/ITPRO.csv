Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.
   

  

 Netflix is looking for a skilled Project Manager to join its newly forming Launch Operations team in Mumbai.
   

  

 This team will be part of a broader operational hub strategy and manages the entire launch readiness process, including on\\-service pre\\-promotional milestones, by combining rigorous Project Management and risk mitigation with a strategic, member\\-first mindset.
   

  

 This is an exciting opportunity for a seasoned Project manager with a knack for workflow innovation in service of delivering Netflix titles to our global members, at scale. If you are analytically minded and your attention to detail is unmatched, you excel at challenging the status quo and influencing change, you thrive in a global team, possess a high level of intellectual curiosity, and demonstrate strong judgment in the face of ambiguity, then this role is for you. The role gets messy and the work we do is predominantly behind\\-the\\-scenes. We are the engine that keeps the Product moving. So if you can keep your ego in check, then we definitely want you to apply!
   

  

 The role involves managing a large volume of titles across the global slate, driving effective communication and alignment across multiple stakeholders in different regions, tracking and managing dependencies and moving launch targets, predicting and mitigating risks, and ensuring our titles launch with a full suite of assets.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* The role has an equally important duality to it \\-


 You will own and be accountable for the end\\-to\\-end, on\\-service project management of titles from across the globe. While multiple teams (internal and external) are responsible for creating and delivering assets, you will be responsible for ensuring those assets are coming in at the right time and keeping the project (each title) moving towards a predetermined launch date that all of your stakeholders are aligned to.
   

  

 You will help shape and redesign existing workflows to help accelerate the efficiency of our operations in line with key business objectives for our group.
   

  

* Partner with internal and external teams (vendors) to ensure operational momentum and seamlessness across launches.
* Exercise sound judgment and risk mitigation to create/modify delivery and launch plans including use cases that fall outside the norm.
* Partner with our Technology, Engineering, Partnerships, and Quality Control teams within Product Discovery and Promotion (PDP) Operations, to guide tooling, workflow, and vendor needs to help scale operations.


**What You’ll Need**
* Excellent project management skills and the ability to keep multiple priorities moving at the same time.
* Extensive experience in contributing to scale initiatives/projects with clear business impact
* Experience externalizing workflows to vendors
* Experience in a global organization and team
* Excellent verbal and written communication skills
* An analytical and innovative mindset
* A passion for operations and a thirst to do more with less, to work smarter not harder
* A tools\\-first mentality reserving human activity for where judgment and communication are critical
* The ability to build deep cross\\-functional relationships
* A business and team\\-first attitude (naturally selfless)
* A self\\-starter mentality (takes initiative)
* An optimistic, solutions\\-driven attitude in the most challenging situations
* Fluency in an additional language is a bonus
* The ability to adapt to the Netflix culture and values


 Inclusion is a Netflix value and we strive to host a meaningful interview experience for all candidates. If you want an accommodation/adjustment for a disability or any other reason during the hiring process, please send a request to your recruiting partner.

 — from AI\\-powered analytics dashboards to custom CRMs, chatbot\\-based mobile apps, internal tools that run our operations, and more
* **Opportunities to grow** 
 — into product management, business ops, or client strategy — wherever you shine

 The Yum! Brands story is simple. We have the four distinctive, relevant and easy global brands – KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and The Habit Burger Grill \\-\\- born from the hopes and dreams, ambitions and grit of passionate entrepreneurs. And we want more of this to create our future!
   

  

 As the world’s largest restaurant company we have a clear and compelling mission: to build the world’s most love, trusted and fastest\\-growing restaurant brands. The key and not\\-so\\-secret ingredient in our recipe for growth is our unrivaled talent and culture, which fuels our results.
   

  

 We’re looking for talented, motivated, visionary and team\\-oriented leaders to join us as we elevate and personalize the customer experience across our 48,000 restaurants, operating in 145 countries and territories around the world!
   

  

 We put pizza, chicken and tacos in the hands of customers through customized ordering, unique delivery approaches, app experiences, and click and collect services and consumer data analytics creating unique customer dining experiences – and we are only getting started.
   

  

 Employees may work for a single brand and potentially grow to support all company\\-owned brands depending on their role. Regardless of where they work, as a company opening an average of 8 restaurants a day worldwide, the growth opportunities are endless. Taco Bell has been named of the 10 Most Innovative Companies in the World by Fast Company; Pizza Hut delivers more pizzas than any other pizza company in the world and KFC’s still use its 75\\-year\\-old finger lickin’ good recipe including secret herbs and spices to hand\\-bread its chicken every day.

 The IT department is navigating a period of significant transformation, with over 42 projects slated for the next three quarters, 26 active projects a number that will increase further with the two scheduled acquisitions. While IT consistently delivers high\\-quality results, the current project management structure requires enhancement to maintain efficiency and ensure continued success. Here’s why adding another Project Manager is a strategic, forward\\-thinking investment:
   

  

**Addressing The Loss Of External Resource**
* The DealHub external Project Manager resource is transitioning out, which creates an opportunity to bring the function in\\-house for greater control and stability.
* High\\-impact initiatives like DealHub are critical to business operations, and ensuring proper oversight is key to their success.
* Currently, Tiffany is dedicating over 15 hours weekly to manage DealHub, which illustrates the demand for specialized project management attention.
* Adding a Project Manager eliminates potential gaps and delays while ensuring priority initiatives remain on track.


**Mitigating Project Risks**
* With over 40 active projects, a single Project Manager handling 14 major initiatives can lead to potential bottlenecks or capacity strains over time.
* A second Project Manager enables a more balanced allocation of resources, helping maintain project timelines, coordination, and quality expectations.
* Given the scale of upcoming projects, proactive adjustment to the project management framework ensures deliverables continue to meet or exceed expectations.


**Enhancing Collaboration And Focus**
* Project Managers specialize in driving accountability, communication, and cross\\-team alignment, which are essential for delivering complex projects successfully and efficiently.
* A distributed approach where some managers self\\-manage their projects is working well so far; however, scaling this model during growth phases may pose challenges.
* Adding a Project Manager prevents key priorities from being overshadowed or misaligned, ensuring all projects benefit from consistent leadership and oversight.


**Supporting Leadership To Foster Innovation**
* IT leadership plays a key role in areas such as solution architecture, strategy development, mentorship, and team building, contributing to business growth and innovation.
* Shifting project oversight responsibilities from technical leadership to professional resource management allows managers to focus on efforts that add significant value.
* The time reclaimed from this transition can be dedicated to enhancing processes and driving organizational improvements, while ensuring the team stays aligned with strategic and technical goals.


 With an expanding portfolio and mission\\-critical projects ahead, investing in an additional Project Manager reinforces agility, supports sustained growth, and strengthens IT’s ability to deliver continuous value to Kaleris.
