**Who We Are**

We are a team of strategic thinkers who have led some of the world’s largest technology launches, litigations, and IP battles. Global technology leaders turn to us for guidance when developing new ideas, pursuing innovation, or seeking a competitive edge.

We belong to the **Intellectual Property (IP)** industry — one that’s ever\\-growing and at the forefront of technological evolution. We’re known to be *“the tip of the technological spear.”*

**What We’re Looking For**

At **GreyB**, we don’t just hire skill — we hire mindset. Here’s what we value (and what you’ll be tested for):

* **Quick on the Uptake:** Fast learner who can understand new technologies across diverse domains.
* **Creative Thinker:** Someone who can connect dots, recognize patterns, and think beyond the obvious.
* **Problem Solver:** Ability to approach real\\-world and client problems logically and strategically.

* **Communicator:** Strong written and spoken communication skills — clarity and confidence matter.

**We Are Hiring For:**

**Research Analysts / Patent Analysts**

Ask yourself:

* Do you have strong technical acumen but don’t see yourself in a typical software or core engineering job?
* Do you crave analytical challenges and want a workplace that rewards curiosity and thinking?
* Do you want mentorship and a chance to grow faster than you imagined?

If yes, this is where you belong.

**What You’ll Gain (if you work hard enough!)**

In 2–3 years, you’ll acquire skills that even top B\\-school graduates envy. You’ll dive right into meaningful work, solving real problems for real clients.

* **Technology Expertise:** Use your engineering foundation to understand inventions, research technologies, and translate findings into actionable reports.
* **Project Management:** Manage multiple projects with different timelines, learning planning, prioritization, and execution.
* **Leadership:** Get exposure to strategy discussions with senior management and take ownership of outcomes.
* **Business Acumen:** Learn how technology drives business growth and operational excellence.
* **Teamwork \\& Collaboration:** Work with cross\\-functional professionals, learning how to leverage team strengths.
* **Problem\\-Solving Mindset:** Tackle complex technical and business challenges creatively.
* **Adaptability:** Stay on top of emerging technologies and shifting global trends.

**How It Works**

* You’ll receive hands\\-on training in **Intellectual Property** and **technology research**.
* You’ll work on **live client projects** under the mentorship of a Project Manager.
* You’ll be encouraged to explore efficient and creative ways to gather and analyze information.
* You’ll contribute not just analysis — but ideas that add real value to the client.
* You’ll be expected to maintain top\\-notch quality, speed, and clarity in your work.

This job is **not for everyone.**  
If you’re looking for a 9\\-to\\-5 comfort zone, this isn’t it.  
But if you’re hungry to learn, willing to hustle, and ready to use your drive to grow fast — welcome aboard.

**A Note Before You Apply**

Before you hit “Send,” take a moment to make your application stand out. Avoid the generic, templated resume everyone else sends. Think, reflect, and show us *why you’re different.*

**Who We Are**

We are a team of strategic thinkers who have led some of the world’s largest technology launches, litigations, and IP battles. Global technology leaders turn to us for guidance when developing new ideas, pursuing innovation, or seeking a competitive edge.

We belong to the **Intellectual Property (IP)** industry — one that’s ever\\-growing and at the forefront of technological evolution. We’re known to be *“the tip of the technological spear.”*

**What We’re Looking For**

At **GreyB**, we don’t just hire skill — we hire mindset. Here’s what we value (and what you’ll be tested for):

* **Quick on the Uptake:** Fast learner who can understand new technologies across diverse domains.
* **Creative Thinker:** Someone who can connect dots, recognize patterns, and think beyond the obvious.
* **Problem Solver:** Ability to approach real\\-world and client problems logically and strategically.
* **Perseverant:** You don’t give up until the goal is achieved — “hell\\-bent” on results.
* **Communicator:** Strong written and spoken communication skills — clarity and confidence matter.

**We Are Hiring For:**

**Research Analysts / Patent Analysts**

Ask yourself:

* Do you have strong technical acumen but don’t see yourself in a typical software or core engineering job?
* Do you crave analytical challenges and want a workplace that rewards curiosity and thinking?
* Do you want mentorship and a chance to grow faster than you imagined?

If yes, this is where you belong.

**What You’ll Gain (if you work hard enough!)**

In 2–3 years, you’ll acquire skills that even top B\\-school graduates envy. You’ll dive right into meaningful work, solving real problems for real clients.

* **Technology Expertise:** Use your engineering foundation to understand inventions, research technologies, and translate findings into actionable reports.
* **Project Management:** Manage multiple projects with different timelines, learning planning, prioritization, and execution.
* **Leadership:** Get exposure to strategy discussions with senior management and take ownership of outcomes.
* **Business Acumen:** Learn how technology drives business growth and operational excellence.
* **Teamwork \\& Collaboration:** Work with cross\\-functional professionals, learning how to leverage team strengths.
* **Problem\\-Solving Mindset:** Tackle complex technical and business challenges creatively.
* **Adaptability:** Stay on top of emerging technologies and shifting global trends.

**How It Works**

* You’ll receive hands\\-on training in **Intellectual Property** and **technology research**.
* You’ll work on **live client projects** under the mentorship of a Project Manager.
* You’ll be encouraged to explore efficient and creative ways to gather and analyze information.
* You’ll contribute not just analysis — but ideas that add real value to the client.
* You’ll be expected to maintain top\\-notch quality, speed, and clarity in your work.

This job is **not for everyone.**  
If you’re looking for a 9\\-to\\-5 comfort zone, this isn’t it.  
But if you’re hungry to learn, willing to hustle, and ready to use your drive to grow fast — welcome aboard.

**A Note Before You Apply**

Before you hit “Send,” take a moment to make your application stand out. Avoid the generic, templated resume everyone else sends. Think, reflect, and show us *why you’re different.*
