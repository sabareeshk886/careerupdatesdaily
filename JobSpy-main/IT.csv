Denodo is a leader in data management. The award\\-winning Denodo Platform is the leading data integration, management, and delivery platform using a logical approach to enable self\\- service BI, data science, hybrid/multi\\-cloud data integration, and enterprise data services. Realizing more than 400% ROI and millions of dollars in benefits, Denodo’s large enterprise and mid\\-market customers across 30\\+ industries have received payback in less than 6 months. For more information, visit www.denodo.com.
We are a fast\\-growing, international organization with teams across four continents and we work with a cutting\\-edge technology, but that's not all we have to offer. At Denodo, we are like a family and it is of the utmost importance to us that we help support your professional growth every step of the way
**Job Description**

Denodo is seeking a Senior Web Designer (UX / CMS) to lead the ongoing evolution of our corporate website and digital experience. This position sits within the Product Marketing organization—rather than a traditional creative team—so you will work at the intersection of design, messaging, and business strategy.

You will translate executive directives, product positioning, and marketing goals into user\\-centered, responsive, and brand\\-aligned web experiences. This is a hybrid role that combines systems\\-level UX thinking with hands\\-on implementation in our content management system (CMS). You will collaborate with content strategists and developers in your local office and across regions—this is a hands\\-on design role, but not a solo one.

The ideal candidate is a proactive, self\\-directed designer who thrives on clarity, speed, and collaboration. You ask smart questions, connect dots, and create scalable design systems that make the web work harder for the business.**Job Responsibilities \\& Duties**
* Interpret and refine design briefs from Product Marketing, campaign, or executive stakeholders to ensure clear, actionable project scopes.
* Develop wireframes, prototypes, and responsive layouts that align with user goals and business objectives.
* Translate modular content (“chunks”) into reusable web components, collaborating with developers to ensure clean implementation and long\\-term maintainability.
* Ensure the website is fully responsive and optimized for various devices and screen sizes, providing a seamless user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* Implement designs directly within the CMS (Drupal experience preferred) and maintain page templates and style consistency across multiple regions and languages.
* Audit, refine, and evolve web design systems to ensure accessibility, performance, and brand alignment.
* Collaborate cross\\-functionally with content, development, and campaign teams to deliver timely, user\\-centered digital experiences.
* Monitor UX performance metrics and propose data\\-driven optimizations.
* Balance urgency with discipline, delivering fast\\-paced work without compromising design integrity.
* Stay current with the latest web design trends, technologies, and best practices to continually enhance the website and user experience.
**Desired Skills \\& Experience**
**Experience Required**
* Bachelor’s degree in UX or Web Design, Graphic Design, Computer Science, or a related field.
* At least 5 years of proven experience in web design, supported by a strong portfolio demonstrating design and implementation skills.
* High proficiency in design tools such as Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator) and familiarity with front\\-end tools such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, and JavaScript.
* Experience with content management systems such as WordPress, Drupal, or similar platforms.
* Strong understanding of UX/UI principles, responsive design, and SEO best practices.
* Demonstrated ability to translate content strategy into flexible web components.
* Strong collaboration and stakeholder management skills, including working with executives and external agencies.
* Sharp eye for visual and typographical composition with close attention to detail.
* Pragmatic approach to design with consistent, reliable output.
* Excellent problem\\-solving and organizational skills, with the ability to manage multiple projects in a fast\\-paced environment.
* Positive, proactive attitude and openness to giving and receiving constructive feedback.
* Fluent in English, both written and spoken.


**Nice to Have**
* Experience with video editing or motion graphics.
* User research or usability testing experience.
* Understanding of inbound and demand generation marketing concepts.
* Spanish or other language skills are a plus.


**We’d Love to Hear About**
* Web redesign projects you have led or contributed to, including your role and outcomes.
* Experiences partnering with brand or creative agencies, and how you ensured cross\\-platform consistency.
* The types of design or UX problems you most enjoy solving—whether simplifying complex content, improving conversions, or elevating user trust.
* Your favorite modern CMS platforms and how you’ve worked within them to achieve scalable, design\\-consistent results.

  


**Only applications that include a portfolio will be considered.**  


**Why This Role Stands Out**
* Strategic proximity: You will sit within Product Marketing, shaping how Denodo communicates across all digital touchpoints.
* Executive visibility: You will occasionally execute initiatives that originate directly from the CEO or Board.
* Autonomy and accountability: You will see your design work drive measurable business impact.
* Collaborative pace: You’ll be part of a connected global web and content team that values initiative, clarity, and results—where design excellence and speed coexist.
* Global scope: You’ll work across continents and time zones, balancing local collaboration with independent progress, and contributing to a fast\\-evolving digital ecosystem. • Growth and impact: You’ll help shape Denodo’s digital standards and have opportunities to expand your leadership in design systems and global UX.
*Denodo is an equal opportunity employer and prohibits discrimination and harassment of any kind. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, pregnancy, age, national origin, disability status, genetic information, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law.
