Guest Environment Experts will be on their feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended time) and taking a hands\\-on approach to work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 50 pounds without assistance). Doing all these things well (and other reasonable job duties as requested) is critical for Guest Environment Experts – to get it right for our guests and our business each and every time.

Backed by technology with a human touch, we use machine learning and AI to personalise the collections journey and champion positive customer experiences — all so we can change the world of consumer debt for good.  

Founded in Australia, today we're a team of over 300 people living and working around the world. We're rapidly expanding throughout North America, the United Kingdom, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. We’re a $50m revenue (and growing) organisation, having recently completed our Series C funding round, backed by leading investors such as Airtree. Now is an exciting time to join the team as we continue to make the experience of debt resolution smoother, and more human.  

About the Role
We're looking for an Engineering Manager to lead our Forward Deployed Engineering team in the UAE, building our technical presence in one of our most strategic markets. This is a unique opportunity to establish and scale a new engineering function that combines technical excellence with direct customer impact.
As the Engineering Manager for Forward Deployed Engineering, you'll build and lead a team of engineers who work directly with clients and customers, understand their pain points firsthand, and ship solutions that accelerate our growth in the UAE and broader Middle East region. You'll be responsible for both the technical success of your team and the business outcomes they deliver.
This role is perfect for an engineering leader who thrives at the intersection of technology and business, someone who can context\\-switch between shipping and reviewing code, customer meetings, and strategic planning \\- often in the same day.  

The Reality of the Role
This isn't a typical engineering management position. You'll be building a new function from the ground up in a rapidly evolving market.
You'll need to be equally comfortable discussing test coverage percentages with your engineers as you are explaining delivery timelines to a client's C\\-suite. You'll translate between the language of business (""we need this for the ADCB deal"") and the language of engineering (""here's how we architect this for scale"").
### **What You'll Own:**

* **Team Building \\& Leadership**
* Hire, mentor, and develop a small team of forward\\-deployed engineers onshore in the UAE, or nearshore
* Build a high\\-performing engineering culture that balances rapid delivery with technical excellence
* Create career development paths for engineers who want more client exposure
* Foster collaboration between your UAE team and global engineering teams
* Champion our engineering standards while adapting to local market needs
* **Technical Strategy \\& Execution**
* Define the technical roadmap for UAE\\-specific solutions and integrations
* Ensure your team follows our global coding standards, tech stack, and review processes
* Own the technical architecture decisions for regional implementations
* Balance ""ship it now"" urgency with ""don't create technical debt"" sustainability
* Guide your team through complex integrations with partners (FinTechs, Banks, etc)
* **Customer \\& Business Partnership**
* Partner closely with the UAE Managing Director to align engineering efforts with business priorities
* Participate in enterprise client meetings to understand requirements and propose solutions
* Enable the sales team by providing technical expertise during deal cycles
* Transform customer feedback into actionable engineering initiatives
* Measure and communicate the business impact of your team's work
* **Regional Technical Ownership**
* Your team will own:
* Arabic\\-specific technical requirements (SMS workflows, data processing, UI localisation, etc)
* Integrations with UAE and GCC clients for both Receeve and Collect Products
* Automation for UAE\\-specific processes and compliance requirements
* AI\\-powered solutions tailored to the regional market

### **What We're Looking For**

* **Must\\-Have Experience**
* 10\\+ years of software engineering experience with at least 5 years in engineering management
* Proven track record of building and leading engineering teams (3\\-10 engineers)
* Experience managing engineers in a distributed or remote environment
* Strong technical background with ability to conduct code reviews and guide architectural decisions
* Experience with customer\\-facing or client\\-services engineering teams
* Track record of shipping production systems at scale
* **Technical Leadership Skills**
* Deep understanding of software architecture and system design
* Experience with Domain\\-Driven Design and clean code principles
* Familiarity with our tech stack (Go, AWS Serverless, React, Terraform) or similar technologies
* Knowledge of API design, system integrations, and event\\-driven architectures
* Experience with DevOps practices, CI/CD, and modern deployment strategies
* Ability to make pragmatic technical trade\\-offs
* **Business \\& Soft Skills**
* Exceptional communication skills \\- can translate between technical and business stakeholders
* Experience working directly with customers or strong desire to be customer\\-facing
* Proven ability to hire, develop, and retain engineering talent
* Strategic thinking \\- can see beyond immediate technical challenges to long\\-term implications
* Cultural awareness and sensitivity to Middle East business practices
* Entrepreneurial mindset with comfort in ambiguity
* **Preferred Qualifications**
* Experience working in the UAE/GCC region or similar emerging markets
* Arabic language skills (reading, writing, or speaking)
* Background in fintech, banking, or financial services
* Experience building engineering teams from scratch
* Knowledge of UAE regulatory and compliance requirements
* Track record of enabling sales and accelerating revenue through technical solutions
* Experience with the ""forward deployed"" or ""solutions engineering"" model

### **How You'll Work**

* **Team Structure**
* Report to the global Director of Engineering
* Dotted line to the UAE MD for regional priorities
* Start as a hands\\-on manager, building the team while contributing code
* Eventually manage 3\\-5 forward\\-deployed engineers
* Collaborate closely with global product and platform teams
* **Success Metrics**
* Time to onboard enterprise clients (should decrease quarter over quarter)
* Regional revenue per engineer (should exceed global average)
* Technical blockers in sales cycles (should approach zero)

Our jobs aren’t just about mixing drinks. Instead, we want to build an experience that is memorable and unique. Our bartenders have the basics down, but are constantly on the look\\-out for new trends, micro\\-local offerings, and guests’ evolving needs. They are not just a beverage enthusiast, but also the host of the space. Their role goes beyond the bar itself to take ownership of guest service more broadly and do what needs to be done. Bartenders will use their knowledge and expertise to make the bar look and function flawlessly. They will build relationships with others across the hotel and in the community, to anticipate and deliver on our guests’ needs. They should be passionate about the guest service experience, but also have an eye for detail – from the money that moves through their hands, to the information they provide to guests, to the quality of their drinks.

*“Whatever you do – whether for work or pleasure – do it with passion! Live with passion,”* wrote Christian Dior.
  

Well before he embarked on his destiny as a couturier, Christian Dior was fascinated with art. The young Normandy native and several friends opened an art gallery when he was just 23\\. In 1938 he learned the métier of pattern cutter with Robert Piguet and three years later began working as a designer for Lucien Lelong. Right from the founding of his Maison in 1946, he transformed his dreams into irresistible creations, seeking to break with the somber war years by elevating pure joy. His visionary spirit celebrated and enchanted women the world over. In only ten years, Monsieur Dior revolutionized the conventions of elegance and femininity, designing collections infused with dreams.","Retail","https://ae.indeed.com/cmp/Christian-Dior","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/dad2d4518ae5ab7218bebf0c965b2646","https://www.dior.com/","30 avenue Montaigne, 75008 Paris","1,001 to 5,000","$500M to $1B (USD)","","","","","","","","","",""
