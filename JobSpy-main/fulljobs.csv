 But we’re not just a fintech company. We’re a storytelling engine for India’s builder culture.
 



 From Razorpay (the brand) to Razorbae (our internet alter ego), we make startup life, money talk, and founder chaos actually fun to follow.
 



 We’ve built India’s most founder\\-loved brand — and now, we want someone who can make it even louder online.
 



  





 We’re looking for an Associate, Social Media Marketing professional who’s built different — someone who scrolls till 3 AM, saves trends before they trend, and can smell a viral moment before it drops.
 



 You’ll help run Razorpay and Razorbae’s entire social world — mixing founder culture, fintech smarts, and pure internet energy.
 



 Think of it as being part editor, part trend hunter, part chaos\\-architect.
 



 If you’ve ever thought “I could’ve done that post better,” this is your shot to prove it.
 



  





**What You’ll Actually Do** 



* Run Razorpay \\+ Razorbae on Insta, LinkedIn, X, and YouTube Shorts — daily.
* Find trends before the trend accounts do. Re\\-spin them for startups, founders, and the Razorpay universe.
* Write captions that sound like a person, not a press release.
* Drop memes, reels, and threads that get people talking.
* Be in brainstorms, and maybe on camera when the vibe’s right.
* Team up with editors and designers to turn ideas into scroll\\-stoppers.
* Use AI tools to draft, caption, remix, and move fast.
* Track what hits, tweak what doesn’t, and keep experimenting.
* Basically: keep Razorpay in people’s feeds and heads.



  





**Who You Probably Are** 



* 1–2 years into the game (college, freelance, meme page, side hustle — all good).
* You’ve made stuff — posts, reels, memes, edits — that
 *actually worked.*
* You live online: Reels, Shorts, Threads, Substack, maybe even Reddit.
* You get why something blows up, not just how.
* You write like a human and think like a creator.
* You’re comfortable being on\\-camera and unfiltered.
* You’re allergic to “corporate social media.”



  





**Bonus Points If** 



* You’ve grown a page, brand, or creator account.
* You’ve gone viral (or know exactly how you would).
* You know your way around CapCut, Canva, ChatGPT, Runway, OpusClip.
* You think “content calendar” is just a fancy word for “moment radar.”



  





**Why You’ll Love It** 




 You’ll be part of a small, dangerous team that runs one of India’s boldest brands. No approvals that kill ideas. No endless decks. Just ideas → edits → posts → feedback → do it again, better.
 



 If you’re hungry, restless, and obsessed with how the internet moves — come build the next wave of brand storytelling with us.
