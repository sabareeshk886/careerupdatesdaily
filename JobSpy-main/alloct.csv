Join us, and help ensure our customers data is always safe, resilient, and ready for the future. Imagine this: You log into work on a Monday morning, and the code you wrote last week is already protecting petabytes of customer data across the globe. A new feature you designed is being used by Fortune 500 enterprises to keep their business running even when disaster strikes. Every commit you make has the potential to safeguard critical workloads for millions of users.

 The Azure Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) team is building a next\\-generation data protection and resiliency platform. With data volumes crossing into exabytes, we’re at the cutting edge of distributed storage and cloud resiliency.

Join us, and help ensure our customers data is always safe, resilient, and ready for the future. Imagine this: You log into work on a Monday morning, and the code you wrote last week is already protecting petabytes of customer data across the globe. A new feature you designed is being used by Fortune 500 enterprises to keep their business running even when disaster strikes. Every commit you make has the potential to safeguard critical workloads for millions of users.

 The Azure Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) team is building a next\\-generation data protection and resiliency platform.

We’re designing for massive scale with a multitenant, microservices\\-based architecture and generalized data store. This is an opportunity to shape a system that will be the foundation of Azure’s reliability story for years to come.

You’ll partner with teams across Azure to deliver seamless integrations and ensure data resiliency across the platform. Every sprint, you’ll tackle new challenges: making services faster, more durable, more secure, and more cost\\-efficient. You’ll live the “customer\\-obsessed, live\\-site first” culture, where solving real customer problems is as exciting as shipping new features.
   

  

 Microsoft’s mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.

 The Azure Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) team is building a next\\-generation data protection and resiliency platform. With data volumes crossing into exabytes, we’re at the cutting edge of distributed storage and cloud resiliency.

We’re designing for massive scale with a multitenant, microservices\\-based architecture and generalized data store. This is an opportunity to shape a system that will be the foundation of Azure’s reliability story for years to come.

Every sprint, you’ll tackle new challenges: making services faster, more durable, more secure, and more cost\\-efficient. You’ll live the “customer\\-obsessed, live\\-site first” culture, where solving real customer problems is as exciting as shipping new features.
