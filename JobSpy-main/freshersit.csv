This is a **Founder’s Office Internship** — which basically means you’ll be working on the things that matter most to the business at any given point.

You’ll work across different areas like **HR, internal operations, people processes, outreach, and day\\-to\\-day coordination.** The nature of the work will change depending on what’s important that week — and that’s exactly what makes it interesting.

You might be:

* Screening candidates, helping draft a hiring process, or onboarding checklist
* Creating internal trackers and documentation
* Researching leads or market segments
* Following up on pending tasks or communication
* Troubleshooting a system we’ve just set up

It’s not a task\\-based internship. You’ll get to see how real decisions are made, how systems are built, and how work gets done behind the scenes of a growing business. If you’re someone who learns by doing, is comfortable with figuring things out, and enjoys variety in your work — you’ll probably enjoy this.

We’re not expecting you to come in knowing everything. What matters more is that you’re available, responsive, detail\\-oriented, willing to take ownership, and genuinely curious about how businesses work.
